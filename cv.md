## **About me** ##
I graduated from BNTU with bachelor degree in logistic. I had working as customer relations specialist in transport logistics center during 5 years.
I have no experience in frontend development, but I believe I can become good developer due to knowledge that I can get at the Rolling Scope School. Subsequently I want to be useful and become a part of team in IT company.
